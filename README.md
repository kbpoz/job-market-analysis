# Analysis of the Data Science Job Market

## Overview
This project analyzes the Data Science job market by scraping job postings from [nofluffjobs.com](https://nofluffjobs.com). Using Python, BeautifulSoup, and data science libraries, the project collects, processes, and models job data to understand trends and predict expected salaries.

## Objectives
- Scrape job offers from a major job portal  
- Clean and prepare the dataset  
- Encode categorical features and group technology stacks  
- Perform exploratory data analysis with visualizations  
- Build a machine learning model to estimate salaries  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- BeautifulSoup (web scraping)  
- Pandas, NumPy (data processing)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)  

## Results
The project delivers insights into job requirements, technologies, and salary expectations in the Data Science field, alongside a predictive model for salary estimation.
